# How it works

This project is part of the hands-on requirement for prove of concept as a devops student
It shows knowledge of devops tools such as containerization tools like Docker and Kubernetes

At the end of the project, one should be able to deploy a containerized app to kubernetes cluster

# Prerequisites
The basic requirements to carry out this project are devops tools.My explanation is centered on the windows operating system

You  need to have the following installed on your system
A python software (see the official website for installation guide and documentation)
